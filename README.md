# nbgrader
The lab files contain macros like '#BEGIN SOLUTION' and '#END SOLUTION' that are meant to be used with nbgrader: https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader

The entire course was served from a docker container running on a 20-core xeon workstation. This was adequate for a class of 30 students. The docker container can be installed using this github repository: https://github.com/maxrudolph/nbgrader-jupyterhub-dockerfiles

Note that nbgrader is a rapidly evolving project and there could be some incompatibilities. Please email me (maxrudolph@ucdavis.edu) or make a pull request when things break.

*If you are an instructor and want access to the solutions, please email me.*

Note: The textbook for this course was **Mathematical Modeling of Earth's Dynamical Systems: A Primer** by Slingerland and Kump. Some of the exercises are derivative of examples from the text.
