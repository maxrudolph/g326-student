    "This week we will use the computer as tool to solve a differential equation. The differential equation that you will solve describes the time evolution of many zero-dimensional (box) models. The form of the solution is by now very familiar and leads to exponential behavior in time. In general, when an analytic solution exists, it is preferable to use this solution. However, because this may be the first time that you've solved equations numerically, I have chosen a problem that has an analytic solution so that you can *verify* that your numerical solution is correct. The numerical solutions that you obtain should all be very similar to the exact solution (within a few percent, usually much closer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the general form of the decay equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d u}{dt} = -\\lambda u                \n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to the Initial Condition (IC):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(0) = u_0$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $u(t)$ is the amount of a radioisotope. This equation has a simple analytic solution for $u(t)$ with which you are familiar. In general, when we obtain an analytic solution to a differential equation, we obtain an expression that allows us to calculate the value of $u(t)$ for every time $t$. On the other hand, when we obtain a numerical solution to this equation, we will calculate approximate values of the solution at specific, discrete, times. For now, we will assume that these times are uniformly spaced, with spacing $k$. We refer to this spacing $k$ as the time step. We use a superscript $n$ to denote the time corresponding to the $n$-th time. We can state mathematically the relationship between the $n$-th time and the preceding time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "t^n = t^{n-1}+k\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that here the superscript $n$ is NOT an exponent.** It is an index referring to the $n$-th time at which we obtain an approximation to the solution. The reason that we use this seemingly confusing notation is that we will later use subscripts to denote spatial indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will refer to the approximation to the function $u(t)$ at time $t=t^n$ as $u(t^n)=u^n$. Again, $n$ is **not** an exponent - it is a superscript identifying the time at which a solution is obtained.\n",
    "Now that we have *discretized* time and introduced notation for the values of the dependent and independent variables at each time step, we need to discuss how we might go about approximating the derivative $\\frac{d u}{dt}$ numerically. We will consider four choices today and express them in terms of the general first-order ordinary differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d u}{dt} = f(u(t),t)\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, we obtain a numerical approximation by introducing a discrete approximation to the derivative $\\frac{du}{dt}$ at time $t^n$. The first choice is referred to as \\textit{forward Euler} or sometimes \\textit{Euler's method} and involves the approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d u}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t^{n}} = \\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{k} \n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{k} = f(u^{n},t^{n})\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: In expressions involving superscripts that refer to a particular instant in time (e.g. $t^n$), we can always replace $n$ with any other expression. For instance, we can substitute $m=n+1$ in the previoux equation to obtain:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{u^{m}-u^{m-1}}{k} = f(u^{m-1},t^{m-1})\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that here, when calculating the value of $u(t)$ at time $t^{n}$, the function $f$ is evaluated at the previous time $t^{n-1}$. Because this method involves only the value of the solution at time $t^{n-1}$, it is called an *explicit* method.\n"

    "1. Create a time vector called `t`. It is good programming practice in general to first create variables representing the initial time, the final time, and the number of time steps. Then, if you need to refer to these values elsewhere in your program, you can use the variable names rather than typing in a numerical constant. If you decide, for instance, that you need to revise your code and take smaller time steps (this is a hint of things to come...), you can do so with a one-line change instead of changing every instance of the number of time steps. \n",

Make a **log-log** plot showing the size of the timestep taken on the horizontal axis and the relative error on the vertical axis. Plot the relative error for each scheme using a different choice of line color or symbol (i.e. you should have one line for the Runge-Kutta scheme, one line for the Forward Euler scheme, and one line for the Backward Euler Scheme). Note - you will have to either run your code above repeatedly with different values of `nt` (either in a separate notebook or this one) and make a data table containing the relative error values, OR you can write a more complicated `for` loop that iterates over all of the choices of time step and makes the plot, all in one go."
