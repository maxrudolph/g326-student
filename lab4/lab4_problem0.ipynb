    "This week's exercise will have you develop a model of the Neoproterozoic Ocean Carbon cycle. The model is based on one proposed by Rothman et al. (2003) in a paper that appeared in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It's available on D2L. Here is the abstract of the paper, to provide some context:\n",

    "``The existence of unusually large fluctuations in the Neoproterozoic\n",
    "(1,000-543 million years ago) carbon-isotopic record implies strong\n",
    "perturbations to the Earth's carbon cycle. To analyze these fluctuations,\n",
    "we examine records of both the isotopic content of carbonate\n",
    "carbon and the fractionation between carbonate and\n",
    "marine organic carbon. Together, these are inconsistent with\n",
    "conventional, steady-state models of the carbon cycle. The records\n",
    "can be well understood, however, as deriving from the nonsteady\n",
    "dynamics of two reactive pools of carbon. The lack of a steady state\n",
    "is traced to an unusually large oceanic reservoir of organic carbon.\n",
    "We suggest that the most significant of the Neoproterozoic negative\n",
    "carbon-isotopic excursions resulted from increased remineralization\n",
    "of this reservoir. The terminal event, at the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary, signals the final diminution of the reservoir,\n",

    "The model that Rothman et al. (2003) develop is very simple in that it contains only two pools of carbon. One pool represents the dissolved inorganic carbon whereas the other represents the dissolved organic carbon. The model that you will develop to describe this system is a **Box model**. In a box model, multiple **boxes** or reservoirs are present. One or more quantities can be exchanged among the different boxes. Describing a box model requires quantifying the rates of exchange of quantities between boxes as well as the rate of addition or removal from the system, as shown in Figure 1 (from Slingerland and Kump Chapter 3). \n",

    "Based on the quantities $M_1$ and $M_2$ shown in Figure 1, we can develop a mathematical description of the system that will allow us to study how the amount of carbon present in the dissolved organic carbon reservoir and the dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir changes if the carbon input to the ocean system ($F_{01}$) changes abruptly. In particular, if we assume that the fluxes of Carbon between the two boxes $F_{12}$ and $F_{21}$ as well as the rate of burial of inorganic carbon $F_{10}$ are linearly proportional to the mass of carbon in the box from which each arrow emanates. Put mathematically, we will assume that:\n",
